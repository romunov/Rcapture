This fork was started to make developing of [edgeEffect](https://bitbucket.org/romunov/edgeeffect) package a bit easier. Fork differs from the original in at least these aspects:

* additional function `rbindCIs` (see its helpfile for more info)
* profileCI no longer plots the profile by deault (introduced argument `verbose`)
* NAMESPACE is written using `roxygen2` system
